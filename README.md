# Vireo

Vireo is a Discord bot that allows multiple servers to subscribe their channels to portals which then transmits any messages sent to all channels subscribed to the portal. This bot does approximately the same thing as the Connections bot and the Connecty bot. However, this bot has some improvements over existing solutions (e.g. cross-server message editing and deletion can be done natively on the Discord UI rather than through a command), but still remains a work-in-progress.
